// Authors: Auronen & Fawkes
//     This patch fixes a bug that is present in ZenGin from G1 onwards. oCInfo instances hold a `told` member variable
//     that indicates, if that oCInfo instance has been told by an NPC/heard by the hero. And the getter method has a
//     condition, that always returns false if the C_INFO is set to `permanent == true`. This is wrong (probably a remnant
//     from the times when ZenGin had multiplayer support) and prevents quite a few dialogues to be played.
